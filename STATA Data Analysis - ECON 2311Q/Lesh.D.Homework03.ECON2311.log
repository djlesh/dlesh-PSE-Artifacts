. *********************
. * b. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the effect of smoking on birthwei
> ght, using each of the regressions.
. 
. * Regression 1:  
. * -253.23 +/- 1.96(26.81)
. * = (-305.797, -200.6597)

. * c. Does the coefficient on Smoker in regression (1) suffer from omitted vari

. 
. * When comparing Smoker in regression (1) to Smoker in regression (3), it can

. *********************
. * e. Consider the coefficient on Unmarried in regression (3). 
. 
. * i. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the coefficient.
. * -187.1332 +/- 1.96(27.677)
. * = (-241.401, -132.865)
. 
. * ii. Is the coefficient statistically significant? Explain.
. 
. * Yes, the coefficient is statistically significant. This is because the p-val
> ue is very low at 0.000. Along with this, the C.I. does not include zero, maki
> ng it statistically significant as well. 
. 
. * iii. Is the magnitude of the coefficient large? Explain
. 
. * Yes, the value of the coefficient is large at -187.1332. This shows that if 
> the individual is unmarried, then the birthweight decreases by this magnitude.
>  When examining this coefficient for weight, this is a considerably large magn
> itude. This shows that this magnitude is large for the coefficient. 
. 
. * iv. A family advocacy group notes that the large coefficient suggests that p
> ublic policies that encourage marriage will lead, on average, to healthier bab
> ies. Do you agree? (Hint: Review the discussion of control variables in Sectio
> n 6.8 Discuss some of the various factors that Unmarried may be controlling fo
> r and how this affects the interpretation of its coefficient.)
. 
. * From the given value of the coefficients, it can be clearly stated on averag
> e that public policies that encourage marriages lead to overall healthier babi
> es. I agree that this is the case. Although "Unmarried" indivudals can mean va
> rious things, Unmarried individuals who have babies out of wedlock may not hav
> e a "father-figure" for emotional, physical, and financial support of the chil
> d. Not having this additional support can lead to much stress, resulting in a 
> decreased of the birthweight of the child. This can also turn the individual t
> o additional alcohol and smoking use while preganant, also affecting the child

>  taken by an individual while pregrant.
