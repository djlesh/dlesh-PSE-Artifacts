. * a) Find the average education level in the sample. What are the lowest and highest years of edu
> cation?
. tabstat educ, stat (mean min max)

    variable |      mean       min       max
-------------+------------------------------
        educ |  12.56274         0        18
--------------------------------------------

. * Average educ level in sample = 12.56274 years 
. * Lowest educ level in sample = 0 
. * High educ level in sample = 18

. * b) Find the average hourly wage in the sample. Does is seem high or low?
. tabstat wage, stat (mean) 

    variable |      mean
-------------+----------
        wage |  5.896103
------------------------

. * Average hourly wage in sample = 5.896103 
. * This hourly wage seems relatively low compared to today's standards of a $7.25 minimum wage flo
> or and a US median income of $61,937 in 2018. 
. **********************
. 
. **********************
. * c) The WAGE data are reported in 1976 dollars. Using the Internet or a printed source, find the
>  Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the years 1976 and 2018.
. * CPI in 1976 = 56.9 with a 5.7% rate of inflation
. * CPI in 2018 = 251.1 with a 2.4% rate of inflation

. **********************
. 
. **********************
. * d) Use the CPI values from part (c) to find the average hourly wage in 2018 dollars. Now does t
> he average hourly wage seem reasonable?
. * 5.87 (1976 hourly wage) * 251.1 (2018 CPI) / 56.9 (1976 CPI) = 25.90
. * Yes, after calculating the average hourly wage in 2018 dollars, the hourly wage in 1976 does se
> em reasonable. It is actually more than the 2018 calculated median hourly wage which was 14.99.

. * There are 252 female in the sample. (female = 1)
. * There are 274 males in the sample. (male = 0)

. * f) What is the average # of years of tenure for men? For women? Show your answer to this in a t
> wo-by-one table, using the table command.
. table female, c(mean tenure)

------------------------

----------+-------------
        0 |      6.47445
        1 |      3.61508

. * Average # of years of tenure for men = 6.47445
. * Average # of years of tenure for women = 3.61508

. * g) Create a two-by-four table showing the average wage, tenure, experience, and education for w
> omen and men, using the tabstat command. What does the Total row of the table show us?
. tabstat wage tenure exper educ, by(female) stat(mean)

Summary statistics: mean
  by categories of: female (=1 if female)

  female |      wage    tenure     exper      educ
---------+----------------------------------------
       0 |  7.099489  6.474453  17.55839  12.78832
       1 |  4.587659  3.615079  16.42857  12.31746
---------+----------------------------------------
   Total |  5.896103  5.104563  17.01711  12.56274
--------------------------------------------------

. * The Total row of the table shows the mean of wage, tenure, exper, and educ for both women and m
> en combined. When seperated using the tabstat command, it shows the mean of wage, tenure, exper, 
> and educ for women and men seperately. As can be seen in the data, men on average have higher wag
> e, tenure, and exper, but almost the same mean educ when compared to women.
